# PreventIdleTimer - Discord Call Timer Prevention Plugin

                                                                                        Still works as of -11/02/2025

## Description
A lightweight BetterDiscord plugin that completely prevents Discord's 3-minute idle timer in voice calls. No more getting kicked when you stay in call alone!

## Why This Exists
I created this plugin because BetterDiscord has repeatedly refused to implement this simple quality-of-life feature, despite numerous community requests. Their stubborn stance is frustrating for those of us who just want to stay connected in voice channels overnight — all because "the idle kick exists for a reason."

## Features
- Completely prevents the 3-minute idle timer in Discord voice calls
- Displays a small indicator in the bottom-right corner when active

## Installation
1. Install BetterDiscord
2. Download `PreventIdleTimer.plugin.js`
3. Move it to your BetterDiscord plugins folder
4. Enable the plugin in BetterDiscord settings

For those who don't want to bother creating their own idle timer solution or dealing with BetterDiscord's reluctance to add this feature here's a ready-to-use solution.
